## Abstract factory design pattern

Is useful when we need to cater multiple variants of a family of products.

Example:

- Electronics: We can have ACs, Refrigerators, Televisions, Microwave ovens of multiple brands
- Automobiles: Bikes, Cars, Trucks etc. of different brands
- Food: Burgers with different patty, sauces etc. etc.

Using abstract factory we need not modify existing code when adding new products or a new variant of a product to the catalog

For example if a new flavor of a burger is being addedd to menu of a restaurant existing menu items
